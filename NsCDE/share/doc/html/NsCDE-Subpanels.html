NsCDE subpanels are simple transient FvwmButton docks. As Front Panel, they
are also as much as possible similar to original CDE forms of the same
purpose. Some applications in them are predefined, and discovered if
installed, and the rest is up to user to populate.
Their purpose is not to show all possible GUI applications installed on the
system as right-click root menu. They are for favorite, important and often
used apps.
</p><p>
There is one main difference between CDE and NsCDE subpanels: <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span>
action calls special NsCDE tool for actions defining. There is no drag and
drop from the app manager (which also doesn't exist).
</p><p>
Subpanels, like in CDE has titlebars but as windows on screen they are without
borders and handles. They have only left menu button like other windows, but
with one exception: there are no actions for closing window and re-positioning
it (no sense in this), but they have "Refresh Subpanel" and "Subpanel
Settings" controls. First one kills process module, re-reads it's
configuration and starts it on the next click on Front Panel subpanel
launcher. Subpanel Settings is the small and simple FvwmScript tool which
allows one to rename Subpanel, set it's width for application titles to fit if
necessary, and to set maximum number of items possible to be installed and
active in that particular Subpanel (by default, this number is 25, but
includes also <span class="emphasis"><em>Install Icon</em></span> action).
</p><p>
On the first change with Install Icon or Subpanel Settings, configuration file
<code class="filename">NsCDE-SubpanelX.conf</code>,
where <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is a subpanel's number on the Front Panel from
left to right is copied as default from the system config to the
<code class="varname">$FVWM_USERDIR</code>, from where it is read instead of default system from now on.
Of course, as anything else, they can be edited in text editor. Syntax is
from the FvwmButtons(1) but if user wants to retain look and feel, configuration
lines must remain long, and follow exact configuration line with all
parameters in order to be just items on the Subpanel with icon and title.
On the top of every Subpanel configuration, there are 3 FVWM internal
infostore variables: for width, number of rows, and Subpanel name.
</p><p>
Presently, there is one workaround here: as much as FVWM, and specially FvwmButtons are
very flexible and configurable, no title for the buttons app can be set apart
from module alias, but module alias doesn't support names with spaces in them.
Internal names as <span class="emphasis"><em>"NsCDE-SubpanelX"</em></span> are for that reason referenced in
<code class="filename">NsCDE-FrontPanel.conf</code>, and are internally mandatory names of their Subpanels.
Since there is no configuration option for subpanel to set Window Title, we are using here
tool <span class="command"><strong>xdotool(1)</strong></span> which is run on Subpanel initialization with a delay of 3,2
seconds (internal workaround for xdotool) and this then takes infostore
variable <code class="varname">NsCDE-SubpanelX-Name</code> and sets literal, system default or user picked
name of the subpanel. Other option is to apply FvwmButtons patch which introduces a
<span class="emphasis"><em>WindowName</em></span> option to it's configuration. Of course, patch will be proposed
to thee upstream FVWM for wider use.
</p><p>
The rest about Subpanel, or to say their visible outfit, and their main function
are the same as in CDE - a nice, heavyweight and elegant application launchers.
